# AudtingApp
The first App I created for my first coop term overseas.

Unfortunately because of the way that my employer set up their backend systems, you will not be able to do anything with the app.
You will be able to launch the app but you will not be able to login or access it. You must be connected to their internal internet connection
inorder to access the server this app relies on.
